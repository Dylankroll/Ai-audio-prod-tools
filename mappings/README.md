# Mapping files

Many scripts in this repo use simple `.txt` or `.csv` mapping files to drive behavior (expected file names, custom labels, ordered lists, etc.).

This repository includes placeholder examples only. Replace them with your own project mappings when using the scripts locally.

If a script can delete or rename files, treat the mapping file as the source of truth and review it carefully first.
