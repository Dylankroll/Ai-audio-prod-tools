# Overview

These scripts are intended as production-minded helpers for AI-assisted audio workflows.

A typical flow looks like this:

1. Start with a script or section plan (often represented as a simple mapping file).
2. Generate or record audio in batches.
3. Split and label outputs so each section is easy to edit, QA, and deliver.
4. Run naming and inventory checks to catch missing or misnamed assets before handoff.
5. Convert to delivery formats (when needed) and perform controlled cleanup.

The goal is to make the correct output the default by relying on explicit mappings and repeatable steps.
